# BloomsTaxonomy
ML algorithm for paper assessment using Blooms Taxonomy. This can be used to assess any subjective question paper. If you give the file as the input , the model will give you the level of the paper.

So for example:

If you give a question paper as follows:

<img src="images/qp.png" height="400" width="500">

You get:

<img src="images/ap.png" height="400" width="500">
